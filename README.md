# Tracebook

Tracebook is an Android app that for contributing to the OpenStreetMap project.

### Features

It lets you:

 - record GPS traces
 - record points of interest
 - make notes
 - record audio notes
 - shoot photos paired with your current position
 
 ### History
 
 Tracebook was mainly developed in a student project at the Freie Universität Berlin. Goal of the software project was to use
 mapsforge Android map to build an Android app that helps contributing to the OpenStreetMap project. For this you need to be
 able to record GPS traces, record single points of interests and annotate those with sufficient data, to remember what has been
 recorded. Annotations can be made using text, audio recordings and photos. At home the data can be imported into jOSM. 
 In jOSM the OpenStreetMap is then edited using the collected data.
 The results of this software project can be found in swp-dv-ws2010-osm-1.
 
 After the project has finished I continued this project in my bachelor thesis.
