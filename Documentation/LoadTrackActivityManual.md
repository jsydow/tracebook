Introduction
============

In this screen the user can view a list of all recorded tracks. You can
also view details, delete, rename and load tracks.

Details
=======

The following screen shows the screen as it should appear to you when
you enter it:

The large part of the screen contains a list of all recorded tracks. If
there is no recorded track, then the list will be empty. For every track
the name of the track is shown and below its name the comment that was
saved for it.

The button showing the gear will open the preference menu. The button
showing a magnifying glass will open the search box. The search box lets
you search for tracks. If you enter a part of a track name then only
tracks that contain this part are displayed in the list below like this:

Working with list entries
-------------------------

A short click will load the track. This may take a few seconds. A long
click on a track will show the context menu for the track. It should
look like this:

The choices are pretty straight forward. There is not much to explain
here. If you choose "Track details" a dialog shows information of the
selected track.
