On top of this view you can see the "Node id:" of the current element.
If you want to add some media files like pictures, videos, voices or
text notes just press one of the media buttons.

If there is no tag for the given element, the list of meta tags above
the media buttons is empty. Otherwise you see all linked tags with your
given category and value pair.
