If a track is currently being recorded when you are back here on this screen, you can resume it by clicking the "Resume Track" button, which is being shown instead of "New Track".

Furthermore, the option menu offers the possibility to set common preferences, as well as showing some help and information about !TraceBook.

By clicking "Close", tracking will be ended and !TraceBook will be closed. At this point, no more GPS information will be acquired by !TraceBook.
