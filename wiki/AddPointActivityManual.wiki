On top of this view you can see the "Node id:" of the element which you want to give meta & mediatags. If you want to add some media files like pictures, videos, voices or text notes just press one of the media buttons.

If there is no metatag for the given element, the list of meta tags below the media buttons is empty. Otherwise you see all linked meta tags with your given category and value pair.
