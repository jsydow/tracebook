At the top you can switch between three views. Here you see the "New" view. This view includes five buttons. The first button in this row is the "Start way" button. 
On the left side you see the icons which represent streets, areas, and points of interest in !TraceBook.

If you press the "Start way" button, you begin to track a new way. The second button "Start area" gets a darker gray color and you can't select it while tracking a street. If you want to stop tracking a street, just press this button again.

Media buttons get visible at the bottom of this view, when you start a street or area. With these media buttons, you can link videos, pictures, text notes or voice messages to your way or area. If you want to track a single point, press the "Add point of interest" button". If you want to set a note for the whole track, you can insert a message after pressing the add note button.

Here you see a list of all your tracked elements. In each list entry, you can see the same picture on the right side, which identify a POI, way or area. You can see the ID of each element and the coordinates with latitude and longitude. For ways you got start and end coordinates. Also you can see how many media files are linked to the element. If you look at a way or area element, again you can see the additional information of how many points are tracked for this element.
