= Introduction =

Here, you can see a map showing your current location as well as recorded items in your track. Starting a track and registering points of interest are possible in this view, as well.

= Details =

Upon acquiring the first GPS fix, your location on the map is shown as a green marker.

By tapping on the map, you can zoom in and zoom out using the keys in the lower right corner.

== New ==
By clicking on "New" a dialog appears that asks you what sort of data you want to record:

"New POI" will [AddPointActivityManual add a single point of interest].

"New Way/Area" starts a new Way or Area. The new way/area is marked on the map as green line:

When a way/area is recorded the dialog opened with the "New"-button will let you end or [AddPointActivityManual edit the way].

A recorded POI is marked as a red marker. On the following screenshot you also see a finished way as a blue line:

== Bugs ==

!TraceBook lets you also record Bugs. Bugs are errors in the !OpenStreetMap. They serve as a note, so that you know later where you want to correct errors. Additionally !TraceBook will show Bugs that are recorded in [http://openstreetbugs.schokokeks.org/ OpenStreetBugs].

"Download bugs" will download the !OpenStreetBugs-Bugs. "New Bug" will add a new Bug at the current position (if you do not have a GPS fix the center of the map is regarded as the current position). "Export Bugs" will export all of your recorded Bugs to an OSM-XML-file. You can import them to JOSM as a layer.

== List ==

The List-Button will lead you to a list of all map data recorded. A long click on a list item will give you a dialog to edit the data.

== Info ==

The Info-Button will lead to a screen that summarizes this track. You can add a comment for this track, rename the track and export it. A TBT-File is then created in the directory `/sd-card/TraceBook/<trackname>/` that can be imported to JOSM using our JOSM plugin.

The map has an options menu:

"Online-Map" will switch between the online and offline map.
"Export" will export the track as described above.
"My location" will center the map on the current position.
"Toggle markers" will enable or disable the markers for all way points.
