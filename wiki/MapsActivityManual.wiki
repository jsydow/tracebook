= Introduction =

Here, you can see a map showing your current location as well as recorded items in your track. Starting a track and registering points of interest are possible in this view, as well.

= Details =

Upon acquiring the first GPS fix, your location on the map is shown as a green marker.

By tapping on the map, you can zoom in and zoom out using the keys in the lower right corner.

== The one-shot mode ==

A tap on the green marker indicating your current location will let you choose between recording a point of interest or starting a way (or an area) in so-called "one-shot mode". In this mode, GPS information only is added to the current way/area when you explicitly want to by choosing "Add way point" after another long tap on the green marker. To finalize your way/area, hit "End way/area" instead.

= Menu =

In the menu, you can center the map to your current location, as well as switching to an on-line map display. You also can stop and pause tracking here. Saving your track explicitly is possible through the menu, too.

Finally, you can toggle markers on the screen. When visible, you can tap on a marker and move it around on the map, add tags to the picked node, or delete that node from your track.
