== Functional things (features) ==

  * ~~search in tracklist~~ `[`done`]`
  * ~~sort by timestamp/name~~ `[`done`]`
  * ~~before renaming track check if there is such a track already~~ `[`done`]`
  * improve waypoint filtering
  * ~~Landscape should not crash/behave strangely~~ `[`done`]`
  * ~~show images of tags~~
  * ~~unhardcode visible strings~~ `[`hopefully done`]`
  * ~~tag history: user can choose between most used and most recently used.~~ `[`done`]`
  * ~~insert statusbar~~ `[`done`]`

== Non-functional ==

  * ~~Logging (one central class, different methods of logging~~) `[`done`]`
  * stability (no leaks, occasional errors, checking for nullpointers etc)
  * optimisation (speed-wise e.g.) (newTrackActivity starts slowly)
  * general usability / gui tweaks
  * Javadoc
