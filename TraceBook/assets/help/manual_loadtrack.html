	<h1>TraceBook - Manual aload track screen</h1>
</div>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>In this screen the user can view a list of all recorded tracks. You can also view details, delete, rename and load tracks.</p>

<h2> Details </h2>

<p>The following screen shows the screen as it should appear to you when you enter it:</p>

<img src="manual_loadtrack_status.png" height="600" width="360"/>

<p>The large part of the screen contains a list of all recorded tracks. If there is no recorded track, then the list will be empty. For every track the name of the track is shown and below its name the comment that was saved for it.</p>

<p>The button showing the gear will open the preference menu. The button showing a magnifying glass will open the search box. The search box lets you search for tracks. If you enter a part of a track name then only tracks that contain this part are displayed in the list below like this:</p>

<img src="load_search.png" height="360px" width="240px"/>

<h3> Working with list entries </h3>

<p>A short click will load the track. This may take a few seconds.
A long click on a track will show the context menu for the track. It should look like this:</p>

<img src="manual_loadtrack_context.png" height="600" width="360"/>

<p>The choices are pretty straight forward. There is not much to explain here. If you choose "Track details" a dialog shows information of the selected track.</p>
